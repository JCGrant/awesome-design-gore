> This is a  curated list of designs that are extremely close to being spot on but just miss the mark, usually due to common misconception or a lack of domain knowledge of the object in question.

> We welcome [Issues](https://github.com/JCGrant/awesome-design-gore/issues/new), and feel free to open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/JCGrant/awesome-design-gore/pulls) if you find any more good examples!
